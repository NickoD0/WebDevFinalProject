        <h1>My reason Why</h1>
        <p>
            Ever since I was a kid I have always loved Motorsport. My earliest memories were of me watching Cars 1
            and the Speed Racer live action movie on repeat (to the chagrin of my parents). I also used to watch full 400 mile Nascar races
            without breaking concentration for even a second, which as a toddler was quite the feat. I lost a bit of interest in my middle
            school years, focusing more on basketball since that seemed to be "closer" to my reality, more tangible than the far off
            heroes of racing I grew up loving.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As I've grown older, however, I've started move from liking racing as a concept to actually understanding how racing works. 
            The rules, the cars, the drivers, the history. For the past 7 years since I've gotten back into racing, I've done my best to 
            truly become knowledgable. And I wanted to make a website to not only express this knowledge, but share it with any fledgeling 
            motorsports fans that were in the same position I was. Maybe this site will accelerate your learning, even if it's just a little.
